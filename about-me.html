            <p style="font-size:10px; color:#1f491e;">Killeney Hill in Dalkey, Ireland- my favorite spot in the Emerald
                Isle.</p>

            <p> Born in Dublin, Ireland, I have always had a strong sense of pride about my heritage.
                I love learning about my Irish history and when I visit my homeland, I do lots of visitations of where my
                ancestors lived.
                I've even seen some of the old houses where my great-great grandparents grew up. I come from both the
                northernmost and
                southernmost counties in Ireland, being Donegal and Kerry, in that order. Having visited almost every other
                year pre-covid,
                I have a strong connection to the sea, the beach, and the Wicklow mountains, along with my sizeable extended
                family.

            <p>
                In my free time, you can find me napping, reading, or watching a dramatic TV show.
                Generally, the media I like to consume is eerie, psychologically thrilling, and dark. Think true crime, or
                dystopian sci-fi. That being said, however, I really am a sucker for those Twilight movies.
                Aside from consuming media, I also enjoy creating it.
                I play guitar and sing, and I enjoy writing songs. I also love to teach, so let me know if you want some
                lessons!
